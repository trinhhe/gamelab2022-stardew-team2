In an exciting expedition to the bottom of the sea a submarine crew of researchers has been entrusted with the task to locate and secure a vast collection of eggs from various rare fish species the likes of which humanity has never seen before... Will the crew be able to conquer the dangers of the ocean floor in order to retrieve the eggs and bring them to the promised location? Curse of the Abyss is a two-player local co-op jump & run style platformer game with a twist: the playstyle for each of the players is asynchronous. On one hand, the player controlling the diver needs to navigate through different environments in a jump and run fashion while collecting as many eggs as possible, being attacked by multiple NPCs and having to overcome many obstacles. On the other hand, the second player has a supportive role and assists the main player from a submarine with its various different functionalities.
